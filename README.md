##Description
Crowd Book is a ruby on rails app that can be used by
music venues to find out which artists their patrons
want to see the most â€” the data collected by Crowd Book\
will better inform the artists the venue books, thereby
selling more tickets, boosting business, and creating a better
experience for music fans.

Venues normally have talent buyers or even a team of tastemakers who help decide which artists will do well at the venue. But even the best talent buyers and tastemakers make mistakes, and those mistakes can mean attended shows. Poorly attended shows are costly for the venue's business and reputation, and bringing an artist the fans aren't interested in cheats the fans out of what could have been a memorable night seeing an artist they resonated with more.

Crowd Book boosts music venues' business and it delivers a better experience to fans.
